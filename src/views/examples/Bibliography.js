                      The circulation of metallic currency within Spanish America and Brazil was surprisingly limited, despite their status as major silver and gold producers. Historians have debated this scarcity, which can be attributed to several key factors:

                        <p className="mb-0">The success of the silver peso as universal money can be attributed to its quality and stability in value, making it a preferred monetary commodity in the early modern period. Merchants valued coins like the silver peso for their fineness, standardized weight, and reliability in monetary circulation.</p>
